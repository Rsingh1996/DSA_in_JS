// These problems involve more complex string operations and can be solved using techniques like sorting, hashing, and two-pointer approaches.

// Run-Length Encoding
// Implement run-length encoding for a given string (e.g., "aabbbcccc" → "a2b3c4").

// String Compression
// Given a string, compress it by replacing repeated characters with the character followed by the count of the repetition.

// String Decompression
// Given a compressed string (e.g., "a2b3c4"), decompress it back to the original string.

// Check if Two Strings are Anagrams
// Given two strings, check if they are anagrams of each other.

// Find All Anagrams in a String
// Given a string and a pattern, find all the starting indices of the pattern’s anagrams in the string.

// Group Anagrams
// Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

// Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
// Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

// Longest Palindromic Substring
// Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

// Find the Longest Common Prefix
// Given an array of strings, find the longest common prefix among them.

// Check if String is a Subsequence of Another
// Given two strings, check if the second string is a subsequence of the first string.

// KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm
// Implement the KMP string matching algorithm for finding a substring in a string.

// Rabin-Karp Algorithm
// Implement the Rabin-Karp algorithm for substring searching.
