Graph 
- A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite number of vertices(also called nodes) connected by edges.
- Trees are specific type of graph data structure.

Type of Graph
- Directed : A graph in which the edges have direction.
Edges are usually represnted by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed.
A---->B---->C
- Undirected : A graph in which the edges are bidirectional.
The graph can be traversed in either direction.
The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected.
A----B----C
C----B----A
