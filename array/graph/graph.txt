Graph 
- A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite number of vertices(also called nodes) connected by edges.
- Trees are specific type of graph data structure.

Type of Graph
- Directed : A graph in which the edges have direction.
Edges are usually represnted by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed.
A---->B---->C
- Undirected : A graph in which the edges are bidirectional.
The graph can be traversed in either direction.
The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected.
A----B----C
C----B----A

Usage -
Google maps 
Social media sites(FB, Insta)

Represntation -
1. Adjacency matrix 
- An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
- Each row and column represnt a vertex
- If the value of any element say, matrix[i][j] is 1, it represnts that there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j.
A----B----C
  A    B    C
 ------------
A|0    1    0
B|1    0    1
C|0    1    0

2. Adjacency list
